\description{
Walks through everything needed to get Perplexica up and running in one
call: checks Docker, starts the container, and guides you through
configuring an AI provider (API key or Ollama). Steps that are already
complete are skipped automatically, so it is safe to call repeatedly.
}
\details{
Must be run in an interactive R session.
